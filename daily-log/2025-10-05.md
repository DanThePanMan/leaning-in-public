# Day 5

## Devops:

-   Learned basic networking concepts, which I was surprised that I did not learn about earlier
-   Learned the 7 layers of OSI model, and how they work together.

This is really cool since I just had a conversation about networking that was quite confusing for me, now it is a lot easier to understand

## MLZoomCamp

-   Started a car price prediction model with data cleaning
-   did some practice with pandas, eventually implementing a linear regression from scratch
