## Day 2, lots of learning

Today marks the first day of actual learnings. In the early stages of both courses, it is very eye opening to see how the concepts that I see all the time work together and finaly make sense to me.

### devops

For the devops course, I mainly learned how things work together and some formal definition of some concepts. For exmaple how the DevOps loop comes together and the difference between CI and CD. Right now I have not been diving deep into the specifics yet, but soon I will be learning GO and actually start working on assignments/projects.

Very excited to get my hands dirty and start working on actually deploying things and keeping it stable, along with setting up pipelines

### ML Zoom Camp

SImilarly, I also learned about lots of the fundamentals.

I learned that in order to train a model, you will need features and targets as the input data, and then only features are needed to make a prediction.

I also learned how ML based models differ from rule based ones, and how it surpasses the limitations of rule based algorithms by predicting with many parameters and spitting out the prediction in percentages that awaits a decision.

Overall it is quite productive, however I do wish that I did more hands-on work. I do think thought hat eventually I will get more hands on and the exciting part of this journy will really begin in about a month or so.
