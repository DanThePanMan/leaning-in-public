# day 3

### DevOps

Learned a lot today, spinning up virtual machines and connecting to my vm using ssh. It is cool to set it all up from scratch and learn how it works fundamentally

It seems like the prep work for this devops course is coming to an end, so I can't wait to get to the fun part.

Here is a bit of an outline of what I have learned today. It is a bit of a mess but that is fine:

-   what is a pointer in GO
-   Linux basic commands
-   how to use vagrant to set up a vm
-   what is SSH
-   how to set up SSH
-   creat an ssh key

### ML zoom camp

for ML, I mostly learned about the basicas about how to solve a problem with ML, and also how to select a model.

still doing some prep work but tomorrow I will be setting up my environment, which will be exciting
