# Day 4

We are at the final stretch of the set-up process. Chapter 1 of the ML course is complete along with the environment set up for DevOps. Next up for DevOps is networking, which I am excited to learn about.

## DevOps

For devops, I spent time learning how to make Bash scripts, and also some system config for Linux. Since I already have a VM this did not take long

## ML

A pretty hefty day for ML, spent some time setting up the venv while installing sime important packages. The course suggested Conda but I would rather just do venv

Then I did some Linear Algebra review, nothing crazy since it is the same as 1st year university but a lot less in depth

After that, I learned some basics of numpy and pandas, which will be more useful in the future when I start to manipulate data and clean.

Overall pretty productive day, can't wait to start with regression tomorrow
